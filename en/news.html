          <!--<h3>Recent Operational Issues <a href="http://ycmetro.org/en/media/ybrtproblem.png">-</a> According to <a href="http://www.fareastbrt.com/en/brt/yichang">Far East BRT</a></h3>
		<p>More recently, in 2017 there have been some serious problems with the Yichang BRT operation, including buses being re-routed out of the BRT corridor, reducing the BRT bus frequency. This in turn has allowed mixed traffic incursions to take place in the BRT corridor, with one side of Xiling Yilu station closed to BRT and opened to mixed traffic. Some of these problems can be attributed to the fact that with only a single bus operator, the government has little leverage and no reliable data availability to rectify decisions taken by the bus company that may benefit the company at the expense of the BRT performance. The risks associated with being reliant on a single BRT operator are discussed <a href="http://www.fareastbrt.com/en/brt/risks#unbundle">here</a>.</p>
<p>The recent operational problems in Yichang need to be rectified if the project is to continue to provide passenger time savings, operational savings, and other benefits. The ridership levels in mid-2017 were much lower than the ridership shortly after the system commenced operation two years earlier, suggesting significant operational deficiences.</p>
<p>Another major issue with the Yichang BRT operations is that too many passengers are forced to make transfers. <a href="http://www.fareastbrt.com/en/feature/gzbrtaug16">As has happened to some extent in Guangzhou as well</a>, the Yichang BRT routes have in some cases been arranged into more of a trunk-feeder than direct service operational configuration, forcing a lot of unnecessary transfers and leading to significant reductions in ridership. The additional transfers also impose an operational cost, slowing boarding and alighting and requiring additional fleet. These problems have been raised since shortly after the opening of the system, but since that time they appear to have been exacerbated rather than improved.&nbsp;</p>-->
